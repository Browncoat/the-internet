        <p>It is small. That is one of the surprising things about The Internet.</p>
        <p>It doesn't have any wires or anything. It's wireless. Much like everything nowadays.</p>
        <p>It is also very light. Of course, The Internet doesn't weigh anything.</p>
        <p>It normally goes on top of Big Ben. That's where it gets the best reception.</p>
